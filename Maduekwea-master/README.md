Welcome to my 6003CEM/JANMAY - 2021/2022 Web API Development GitHub Repository. Project topic is Expense tracker developed using Deno.js.

Assignment task was to create a RESTFul API using Deno framework and also develop a Single Page Application.


My Assignment topic is EXPENSE TRACKER.

An Expense tracker app allows you to monitor and categorize your expenses across different bank and investment accounts and credit cards.

Some of these apps also offer budgeting tools, credit monitoring, mileage tracking, receipt keeping, and advice to grow your net worth.





Tracking your expenses can also help you build an accurate budget.  When creating a budget, especially for the first time,

we may think we know how much we spend on eating out on a monthly basis.

Often what we think we spend on a particular category and what we actually spend are two different amounts!




To Run this application, you have to use  (deno run --allow-all index.js).
